                        <p>Neoclassical painting is characterized by the use of straight lines, a smooth paint surface, the depiction of light, a minimal use of color, and the clear, crisp definition of forms.

                            <p>Romanticism in art can be recognized through the identification of theme, mood and design.

                                <p>Academic art, or academicism or academism, is a style of painting, sculpture, and architecture produced under the influence of European academies of art. Specifically, academic art is the art and artists influenced by the standards of the French Académie des Beaux-Arts, which was practiced under the movements of Neoclassicism and Romanticism, and the art that followed these two movements in the attempt to synthesize both of their styles, and which is best reflected by the paintings of William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Thomas Couture, and Hans Makart. In this context it is often called "academism", "academicism", "art pompier" (pejoratively), and "eclecticism", and sometimes linked with "historicism" and "syncretism".</p>

                                    <p>Realist paintings depict the harsh, everyday reality of ordinary people from the middle and lower classes of society, for example, The Gleaners by Jean-François Millet.</p>

                                        <p>Most of the Pre-Raphaelite characters are women whose beauty is based on real-life mistresses and models of the English painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti. He was the founder of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, a secret art society. His most prominent muses were Elizabeth Siddal, Fanny Cornforth, Alexa Wilding and Jane Morris, all of whom conform to a certain feminine archetype, known to the Pre-Raphaelites as the “stunner.” </p>

                                            <h1>Impressionism</h1>
                                            <p>Impressionist works characteristically portray overall visual effects instead of details, and use short, “broken” brush strokes of mixed and unmixed color to achieve an effect of intense color vibration.</p>

                                                <h1>Post-Impressionism</h1>
                                                <p>The main common characteristic among all the various Post-Impressionist styles is heavy outlines. Artists ditched the fuzziness of Impressionist art and brought back strong emphasis on form. The subject matter did not differ from that found in Impressionist paintings. Artists continued to depict the leisurely life of the urbanite middle class. Many of the scenes were outdoors: beaches and landscapes.</p>

                                                    <p>Symbolist paintings are dim, nightmarish scenes where artistic imagination is overtaken by the morbid and the macabre. The visions are otherworldly and mystical. You’ll find haunting, mysterious figures, evil women, supernatural monsters and demons, and imagery of sex and death. The atmosphere is always unsettling and gloomy.</p>

Objects are deconstructed and “analysed” from different angles, and turned into a fragmented composite. That explains why the first of the two phases of Cubism was called Analytic Cubism.</p>
